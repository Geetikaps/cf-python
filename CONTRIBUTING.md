**Major** changes include
  * comprehensive backwards-incompatible changes to the API;
  * comprehensive refactoring of the code base;
  * support for major-version upgrades to the CF conventions;
  * support for major version changes to the Python language.

**Minor** changes include
  * support for minor-version upgrades to the CF conventions;
  * limited backwards-incompatible changes to the API, such as
    - changing the name of an existing function or method;
    - changing the behaviour of an existing function or method;
    - changing the name of an existing keyword parameter;
    - changing the permitted values of an existing keyword parameter.

**trivial** changes include
  * bug fixes;
  * backwards-compatible changes to the API, such as
    - introducing a new function or method;
    - introducing a new keyword parameter;
    - introducing new permitted values of a keyword parameter;
  * changes to dependecies;
  * changes to the documentation;
